   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Check for required tools
   - Install Stellar CLI if needed
   - Set up the Stellar testnet

### Deploying Contracts to Testnet

To deploy the contracts to the Stellar testnet:

1. Make sure you have [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) installed
2. Fund your testnet account: [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test)
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./scripts/deploy-contracts.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Deploy the Registry, Auth, Data, and Community contracts
   - Save the contract IDs to a `.env` file
   - Set up the contracts for use with the app

### Running the App

To run the application:

## Contract Deployment Workflow

### Building and Deploying Contracts

This project uses a streamlined workflow for building and testing Stellar Soroban contracts. The main tools for contract management are:

1. **Makefile** - Contains all commands for building, testing, and deploying contracts
2. **DeployContracts Component** - Web UI for downloading contract files and providing deployment instructions

### Common Contract Operations

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build:contracts` | Build all contracts and copy to public directory |
| `npm run test:contracts` | Run all contract tests |
| `npm run deploy:contracts` | Deploy contracts to Stellar testnet using soroban CLI |
| `npm run deploy:testnet` | Deploy contracts using stellar CLI and save IDs to .env |
| `npm run clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `npm run optimize:contracts` | Optimize compiled contracts |
| `npm run generate:bindings` | Generate TypeScript bindings |

### Manual Deployment via Web UI

For a more user-friendly approach, you can use the DeployContracts page in the app:

1. Connect your Freighter wallet
2. Download each contract WASM file
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload and deploy each contract
4. Use the contract hash returned by each upload when deploying

This approach is useful when you need to deploy contracts from a different environment than your development machine.

### Deployment Command Details

Under the hood, these commands use the Makefile. To view the specific commands and options:

```bash
# View available make targets
make help

# Specify a custom Stellar address for deployment
make deploy STELLAR_ADDRESS=GBUKOFF6FX6767LKKOD3P7KAS43I3Z7CNUBPCH33YZKPPR53ZDHAHCER
```
