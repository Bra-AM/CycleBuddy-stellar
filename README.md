> "Know your body, Own your cycle" - A Web3-powered menstrual health companion that puts privacy and education first.

## Vision

CycleBuddy revolutionizes menstrual health tracking by combining the privacy and security of Web3 with an intuitive, educational interface designed specifically for young users. We're not just building another period tracker â€“ we're creating a movement to reshape how people learn about and interact with their bodies.

2. **DeployContracts Component** - Web UI for downloading contract files and providing deployment instructions

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build:contracts` | Build all Stellar contracts and copy to public directory |
| `npm run test:contracts` | Run all Stellar contract tests |
| `npm run deploy:contracts` | Deploy Stellar contracts to testnet using soroban CLI |
| `npm run deploy:testnet` | Deploy Stellar contracts using stellar CLI and save IDs to .env |

#### Bahamut Contracts

1. **Hardhat** - Framework for Ethereum/EVM development
2. **Deployment Scripts** - Automated scripts for contract deployment and verification

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run bahamut:compile` | Compile Solidity contracts using Hardhat |
| `npm run bahamut:test` | Run tests for Bahamut contracts |
| `npm run bahamut:deploy:testnet` | Deploy contracts to Bahamut testnet |
| `npm run bahamut:deploy:mainnet` | Deploy contracts to Bahamut mainnet |

# CycleBuddy Bahamut Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts for the CycleBuddy app on the Bahamut blockchain.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- NPM or Yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

### Local Development

1. Start a local Hardhat node in a separate terminal:
   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. The contracts are preconfigured to work with the local Hardhat node. The default accounts and deployed contract addresses are already set up in the `deployed-addresses.json` file.

3. If you want to deploy the contracts manually:
   ```
   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy-local.js
   ```

### Contract Addresses

The `deployed-addresses.json` file contains the addresses of the deployed contracts:

- `CycleStreakToken`: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
- `DailyRewards`: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`

These are the default addresses when deploying to the local Hardhat node.

### Testing with MetaMask

1. Add the local Hardhat network to MetaMask:
   - Network Name: Hardhat Local
   - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - Chain ID: 1337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH

2. Import one of the test accounts using the private key:
   - Account #0: `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`

3. Now you can interact with the contracts through the CycleBuddy app UI.
