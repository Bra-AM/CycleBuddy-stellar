> "Know your body, own your cycle" - A Web3-powered menstrual health companion that puts privacy and education first.

## Vision

CycleBuddy revolutionizes menstrual health tracking by combining the privacy and security of Web3 with an intuitive, educational interface designed specifically for young users. We're not just building another period tracker â€“ we're creating a movement to reshape how people learn about and interact with their bodies.

- [Smart Contracts](docs/smart-contracts.md)

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Traditional period tracking apps often:
- Lack privacy and data security
- Present overwhelming or inappropriate content
- Miss the mark on educational support
- Create anxiety through complex medical forms

### Our Solution
CycleBuddy addresses these issues by:
- Implementing Web3 privacy-first architecture
- Providing age-appropriate, clear guidance
- Building a supportive, anonymous community
- Focusing on education and empowerment

## ðŸŒ± Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/stellar-cli)
- [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) with funded testnet account

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CycleBuddy-stellar.git
   cd CycleBuddy-stellar
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Check for required tools
   - Install Stellar CLI if needed
   - Set up the Stellar testnet

### Deploying Contracts to Testnet

To deploy the contracts to the Stellar testnet:

1. Make sure you have [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) installed
2. Fund your testnet account: [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test)
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./scripts/deploy-contracts.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Deploy the Registry, Auth, Data, and Community contracts
   - Save the contract IDs to a `.env` file
   - Set up the contracts for use with the app

### Running the App

To run the application:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Contract Structure

The application uses four Soroban (Stellar) smart contracts:

1. **Registry Contract**: Central contract registry that tracks the addresses of all other contracts
2. **Auth Contract**: Handles passkey-based authentication and user identity
3. **Data Contract**: Stores encrypted health data with privacy controls
4. **Community Contract**: Manages social and educational features

## Using the Testnet Integration

The application can work in two modes:

1. **Simulated Mode**: When Freighter wallet is not available, the app uses simulated blockchain data
2. **Testnet Mode**: When Freighter wallet is connected, the app interacts with real contracts on the Stellar testnet

To use the testnet integration:

1. Install [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/)
2. Create and fund a testnet account
3. Deploy contracts using the provided script
4. Update your `.env` file with the deployed contract IDs
5. Restart the application

## Troubleshooting

### Contract ID Issues

If you see errors related to invalid contract IDs:

1. Make sure you've deployed the contracts to testnet
2. Check that your `.env` file contains the correct contract IDs
3. Restart the application

### Freighter Connection Issues

If you're having issues connecting to Freighter:

1. Make sure Freighter is installed and unlocked
2. Switch to the Stellar testnet in Freighter
3. Refresh the application

## Contract Deployment Workflow

### Building and Deploying Contracts

This project uses a streamlined workflow for building and deploying Stellar Soroban contracts. The main tools for contract management are:

1. **Makefile** - Contains all commands for building, testing, and deploying contracts
2. **DeployContracts Component** - Web UI for downloading contract files and providing deployment instructions

### Common Contract Operations

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build:contracts` | Build all contracts and copy to public directory |
| `npm run test:contracts` | Run all contract tests |
| `npm run deploy:contracts` | Deploy contracts to Stellar testnet using soroban CLI |
| `npm run deploy:testnet` | Deploy contracts using stellar CLI and save IDs to .env |
| `npm run clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `npm run optimize:contracts` | Optimize compiled contracts |
| `npm run generate:bindings` | Generate TypeScript bindings |

### Manual Deployment via Web UI

For a more user-friendly approach, you can use the DeployContracts page in the app:

1. Connect your Freighter wallet
2. Download each contract WASM file
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload and deploy each contract
4. Use the contract hash returned by each upload when deploying

This approach is useful when you need to deploy contracts from a different environment than your development machine.

### Deployment Command Details

Under the hood, these commands use the Makefile. To view the specific commands and options:

```bash
# View available make targets
make help

# Specify a custom Stellar address for deployment
make deploy STELLAR_ADDRESS=GBUKOFF6FX6767LKKOD3P7KAS43I3Z7CNUBPCH33YZKPPR53ZDHAHCER
```
