> "Know your body, own your cycle" - A Web3-powered menstrual health companion that puts privacy and education first.

## Vision

CycleBuddy revolutionizes menstrual health tracking by combining the privacy and security of Web3 with an intuitive, educational interface designed specifically for young users. We're not just building another period tracker â€“ we're creating a movement to reshape how people learn about and interact with their bodies.
